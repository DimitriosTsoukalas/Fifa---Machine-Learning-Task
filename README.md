# Machine_Learning


ML1 - Evaluation Measures
- Split dataset
- Examining K-fold cross validation
- Presenting confusion matrix
- Presenting classification report

ML2 - Grid Search and Randomized Search
- Apply K-Nearest Neighbor clasisifier
- Define a grid with different parameters
- Identifying the baseline
- Fit the model
- Identify best model
- Visualize with all options
- Alternative approach: Randomized search

ML3 - Feature Selection & Random Forest
- Use of wine dataset
- Applying random forest algorithm
- Check information gain from each feature
- Feature selection apply
- Re-train random forest
